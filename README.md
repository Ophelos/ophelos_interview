# Ophelos Live Coding Task

Welcome to the Ophelos Live Coding Task! ðŸŽ‰

Here you will find a collection of example applications in various languages and
frameworks.

Feel free to use whichever application you feel most comfortable with.

Each application is similar in scope and they focus on solving the same problem.

## What to expect

We'll spend an hour pairing on improvements to affordability statements.

The [MoSCoW method][moscow] should be used to prioritise requirements. Feel
free to include any extra features that you see fit.

We are expecting to collaborate, so please ask questions, communicate your
thinking, and try to relax. We want this to be as close to  "an hour pairing
with a colleague at Ophelos" as possible!
