# How to run
To run this project you need Java and Maven installed.

You can run the project using the following command:
> ./mvnw spring-boot:run

# To test the application
* URL: http://localhost:8080/
* Username: user
* Password: p@ssw0rd!

On the home page you can either "Submit Statement" or "View Past Statement"

You can submit multiple statements but "View Past Statement" always shows the first statement you submitted
(with URL path "/statement?id=1"). You can change the id in the URL path to see any other statement
(as long as the id exists and the statement belongs to the user).

You can't log out and log back in (not implemented...)
